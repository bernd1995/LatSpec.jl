The uncertainty can either be a number for a symmetric uncertainty or a tuple for lower and upper bounds. It can be created by either providing positional arguments (e.g. DataPoint(1.0,0.1) or DataPoint(1.0,(0.09,0.11))) or by using the keyword arguments lower and upper (e.g. `DataPoint(1.0,lower=0.1,upper=0.2). If only one keyword is given, the other is assumed to be zero.\n\nIt can also be created by using the ± symbol, e.g. x ± err.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#LatSpec.autocor-Tuple{Any, Any}","page":"API","title":"LatSpec.autocor","text":"autocor(x,lag)\n\nReturns autocorrelation function for a distance of lag, i.e. between values of x[t] and x[t+lag].
